## Background

I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle, and now live in Durham, North Carolina.

## Research

I'm interested in multivariate data and data with little/no replication. I like thinking in terms of models, but because I'm always worried that models are wrong I'm also interested in model misspecification.

## Interests

Trying to keep my beagle from eating non-food items,  finding new pizzas to try and running or swimming (whichever I haven't recently injured myself doing).
