## Background

Since Fall 2013, I've been a Ph.D. student in the Statistics Department at the University of Washington. My advisor is [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io), and I expect to graduate in June, 2018.

I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle, and now live in Durham, North Carolina. 

## Research

I'm interested in multivariate data and data with little/no replication. I like thinking in terms of models, but because I'm always worried that models are wrong I'm also interested in model misspecification. 

## Interests

Trying to keep my beagle from eating non-food items,finding new pizzas to eat and running or swimming (whichever I haven't recently injured myself doing).
