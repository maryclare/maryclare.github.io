Research
-------

I'm interested in multivariate data and data with little/no replication. I like thinking in terms of models, but because I'm always worried that models are wrong I'm also interested in model misspecification. 

## Background

I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle and the last two in Durham, North Carolina. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision of [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io).

## Interests

Trying to keep my beagle from eating non-food items and my hound from barking at people, finding new pizzas to eat and running or swimming (whichever I haven't recently injured myself doing).
