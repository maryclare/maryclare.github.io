* 10/23/23: ["Structured Shrinkage Priors"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10618600.2023.2233577), a paper about defining and working with correlated generalizations of common shrinkage priors with my advisor [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io), has been selected for the [ASA Editors' Choice Collection](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uasa20/collections/EditorsChoiceCollectionUASA)!


## About Me

I joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor in Fall 2019!
I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle and the last two in Durham, North Carolina, and did a postdoc at Cornell in the Center for Applied Mathematics. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision of [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io). After that, [David Matteson](https://davidsmatteson.com) and [Gennady Samorodnitsky](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/gennady/) tried their best to teach me all about time series! 

## Interests

Chasing my barking hounds and finding new pizzas to eat.
