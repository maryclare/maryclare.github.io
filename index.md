## Background

I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle, and now live in Durham, North Carolina.

## Research

I'm interested in multivariate data and data with little/no replication. I like thinking in terms of models, but because I'm always worried that models are wrong I'm also interested in model misspecification.

## Interests

I enjoy running and swimming, spending time with my beagle and eating food.
