Research
-------

I'm interested in multivariate data and data with little/no replication. I like thinking in terms of models, but because I'm always worried that models are wrong I'm also interested in model misspecification. 

## News

## About Me

I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle and the last two in Durham, North Carolina. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision of [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io). Right now, I'm a postdoctoral associate in the Center for Applied Mathematics at Cornell, where I am learning all about time series from [David Matteson](https://davidsmatteson.com) and [Gennady Samorodnitsky](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/gennady/). In September 2019, I will join the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor!

## Interests

Trying to keep my beagle from eating non-food items, chasing my barking hound, finding new pizzas to eat, and hanging out with my mom [Claire](http://www.griffinink.com), dad [John](http://www.crai.com/expert/john-j-griffin), and sister [Norah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norah-griffin-8451a4146).
