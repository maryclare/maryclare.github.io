Research
-------

I'm interested in multivariate data and data with little/no replication. I like thinking in terms of models, but because I'm always worried that models are wrong I'm also interested in model misspecification.

## About Me

I just joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an assistant professor!
I grew up in Massachusetts, went to college at the University of Chicago, spent the first three years of graduate school in Seattle and the last two in Durham, North Carolina, and did a postdoc at Cornell in the Center for Applied Mathematics. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Washington in 2018 under the supervision of [Peter Hoff](https://pdhoff.github.io). After that, [David Matteson](https://davidsmatteson.com) and [Gennady Samorodnitsky](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/gennady/) tried their best to teach me all about time series! 

## Interests

Trying to keep my beagle from eating non-food items, chasing my barking hound, finding new pizzas to eat, and hanging out with my mom [Claire](http://www.griffinink.com), dad [John](http://www.crai.com/expert/john-j-griffin), and sister [Norah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norah-griffin-8451a4146).
