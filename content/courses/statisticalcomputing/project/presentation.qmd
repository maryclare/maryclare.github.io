title: "Presentation Expectations"
format: pdf
---

Your presentation will be worth 10 points total, with:

* 8 points attributed to your presentation itself, focused on:
  * Quality of presentation 
  * Clarity of organization
  * Legibility of text and/or figures
* 2 points attributed to your answering of questions from classmates

Presentations will be three minutes long, which will go quickly! They should be made up of no more than three slides. I suggest:

* Slide 1: Introduction and relationship to what we did in class (30 seconds)
* Slide 2: Demonstration of the main thing you explored (2 minutes)
* Slide 3: Conclusions and extensions (30 seconds)
