Like all proper labs, my lab has an acronym: BLAST (Bayesian, Latent (Variable) and Spatiotemporal) Lab.

BLAST-Lab has:
  - In person weekly meetings in LGRT 1234 from 3pm-4pm
  - An email list 
  - A Slack channel
  
Please contact me if you'd like to be added to the email list or Slack channel! If you want to attend a meeting, just show up!
